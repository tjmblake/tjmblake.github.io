<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>After my first month of working at Cyclr, I found the same issues were causing sprint tickets to be pushed back into development.</p>
<p>These were typically issues related to field formatting. When you have many methods with 50+ fields each, becomes harder to manually check without spending hours of time on something which could be automated.</p>
<p>Many of these issues did not affect the functionality of the connectors, but caused consistency issues between the connectors.</p>
<p>These were issues which could be broken down into steps, from formatting to more advanced Connector Developer processes, such as evaluating the connectivity of a connector both internally but also externally to other connectors in the library.</p>
<h2>Iterative Problem Solving</h2>
<p>Using Node, I planned and developed an initial prototype to manipulate connector files to perform bulk-validation and fixes of common issues. This proved a success, eliminating a large proportion of common feedback.</p>
<p>I used the Inquirer NPM package to add multi-choice queries to the tool. This allowed Connector Developers to select between validations, confirm operations and make choices which the program could not.</p>
<p>This enabled the script tool to be useful in more situations as it was not required to always make a change, particularly when the decision was more contextual.</p>
<p>Subsequently, with each piece of feedback, I began to consider if an automation solution was possible, no matter the size of the problem. This fed into a trello board, where each item was considered and - if viable - would be added to the tool.</p>
<p>This approach has found us in a situation where no issues which can be automated have not been, affording us much more time to focus on issues which are unique to the specific connector.</p>
<p>Due to completing the available issues, this tool now required very little maintenance and has reached the stage where it's logic will be implemented into the platform.</p>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>By developing this tool seperately, as opposed to implementing it into the Cyclr Platform initially, I was able to accomplish a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster development of the tool, only focusing on the specific use-case instead of having to consider additional factors.</li>
<li>The proof of concept could be verified and tested. We were also able to judge, and benefit from, the tools' effectiveness with clear results in a short timeframce. As it was a success, plans to integrate the logic into the platform are now scheduled.</li>
<li>Momentum of tickets through the sprint is higher, with more tickets passing their 'peer-review' stages first time. Connector Developers do not have to spend time and productivity focus on the automatable tasks.</li>
</ul>
