## Who am I?

My name is Tom. I work as a Software Engineer. I only have a few years experience. 

The languages I have worked with are: 

- Typescript / Javascript
- Go
- PHP
- Lua

I'm interested in learning more about DDD, event-driven architecture and NeoVim.

## Why a blog? 

This blog is not written to be read. I am using it to reinforce the concepts I am learning.
